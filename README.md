# IndieSearch

This is a _very_ early prototype of a browser extension for distributed search for the IndieWeb.

More coming here soon; but please reach out to me at [byjp.me](https://www.byjp.me) if you want more context in the meanwhole.

To get this going on your machine you should be able to:

```sh
cd Extension
npm run build
```

And then "load the unpacked extension" of the `Extension` directory (not the `dist` directory, its parent).

## Honours

This has been thrown together incredibly quickly because of the excellent work by [kyle-n](https://github.com/kyle-n) and their [WebExtensionTemplate](https://github.com/kyle-n/WebExtensionTemplate). Thank you!
